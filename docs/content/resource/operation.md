### Create Offer

A "Create Offer" operation represents the desire of an account to trade 
currencies. It specifies an order book, a price and amount of currency to 
buy or sell.

When this operation is applied to the ledger, trades will be executed by
matching this operation with crossing offers, executing trades in an attempt to
completely will this offer.

In the event that there are not enough crossing orders to fill the order completely
a new "Offer" object will be created in the ledger.  As other accounts make
offers or payments, this offer will be filled when possible.
