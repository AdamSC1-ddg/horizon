**XDR**, also known as _External Data Representation_, is used extensively in 
the Stellar Network, especially the core.  The ledger, transactions, results,
history, and even the messages passed between computers running stellar-core
are encoded using XDR.

XDR is specified in [RFC 4506](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4506.html).

Since XDR is a binary format, not known as widely as JSON for example, we try
to hide most of it from Horizon.  Instead, we opt to interpret the XDR for you
and present the values as JSON attributes.  That said, we also expose the XDR
to your so you can get access to the raw, canonical data.

**NOTE: While Horizon is in development, you can get the most complete access
access to data by reading XDR.**

In general, horizon will render the xdr structures encoded in base64 so that it
is capable to transmit within a json body.  You should decode the base64 string
into a byte stream, then decode the XDR into in memory data structures.

## .X files

Data structures in XDR are specified in an _interface definition file_ (IDL).  
The IDL files used for the Stellar Network are available 
[on github](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/tree/master/src/xdr).
