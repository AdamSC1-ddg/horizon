Horizon is an API server for the Stellar ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [stellar-core](https://www.stellar.org/developers/learn/stellar-core) and applications that want to access the Stellar network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. See [an overview of the Stellar ecosystem](https://www.stellar.org/developers/learn/) for details of where Horizon fits in.

Horizon provides a RESTful API to allow client applications to interact with the Stellar network. You can communicate with Horizon using cURL or just your web browser. However, if you're building a client application, you'll likely want to use a Stellar SDK in the language of your client.
SDF provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://www.stellar.org/developers/learn/js-stellar) for clients to use to interact with Horizon.

SDF runs a instance of Horizon that is connected to the test net: [https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/](https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/) and one that is connected to the public Stellar network:
[https://horizon.stellar.org/](https://horizon.stellar.org/).
